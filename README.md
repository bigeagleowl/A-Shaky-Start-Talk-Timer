# A-Shaky-Start-Talk-Timer

This is a BBC micro:bit count down talk timer to tell you how much time you have left to complete your talk. You start the timer by shaking the micro:bit. It gives you a visual indication as to the time left to give your talk. It starts counting down when you stop shaking it. Initially it lights all LEDs, and as time passes it progressively switches then off. When your time is up it displays a clock animation :-)  

If you have other micro:bits with the "A-Shaky-Start-Talk-Timer" program it broadcasts a start message, which causes then to count down too - cool eh!

This is written in MicroPython.
